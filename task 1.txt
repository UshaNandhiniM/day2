Difference between document and windows object:


1. It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser. vs  It represents browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   

2. It is loaded inside the window. vs  It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

3. It is the object of window property. vs It is the object of the browser.

4. All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document. vs Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

5. The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model). vs The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
